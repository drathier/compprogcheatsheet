Cheat sheet for competitive programming


# Done
- binary search (tst)
- floyd-warshall (uva)
- bellman-ford (Kattis)
- dijkstra (Kattis)
- topological sort, kahn's algorithm (uva)
- minimum spanning tree, kruskals algorithm (kattis)
- segmenttree 2D (uva)

# Needs testing
- fenwick tree
    - including 2d version
- prime sieve

# Improvable
- gcd/lcm/eucl/diophantic
    - hard to read; would inlining some code (and making a non-recursive version) help?
- A-star
    - need to standardize format when including other algorithms

# Todo
- trie
- suffix array/tree (aho-corasick)
    - suffix array is probably easier to write, and usually faster because of smaller memory footprint
- closest pairs
- convex hull
    - jarvis walk or graham scan
        - add note about 2x speedup by running top and bottom separately

- maxflow
    - just assume DFS is already done
- strongly connected components
    - tarjan or path-based strong component algorithm
- matrix exponentiation
- howto solve anything; step by step
- geometry, maths and statistics
    - useful formulas and when to use what
- markov chain / MDP
- Ordo-notation for all algorithms, and their limits etc.
    - probably best if kept in a table, one per area (graph, string etc.)
