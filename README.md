Cheat sheet for competitive programming


# Done
- binary search (tst)
- floyd-warshall (uva)
- bellman-ford (Kattis)
- dijkstra (Kattis)

# Needs testing
- fenwick tree
- prime sieve

# Improvable
- union find
    - missing union by rank optimization, could be faster
- gcd/lcm/eucl/diophantic
    - hard to read; would inlining some code (and making a non-recursive version) help?

# Todo
- trie
- suffix array/tree (aho-corasick)
    - suffix array is probably easier to write, and usually faster because of smaller memory footprint
- closest pairs
- convex hull
    - jarvis walk or graham scan
        - add note about 2x speedup by running top and bottom separately

- minimum spanning tree
- maxflow
    - just assume DFS is already done
- strongly connected components
    - tarjan or path-based strong component algorithm
- topological sort
    - tarjan or kahn
- matrix exponentiation
- howto solve anything; step by step
- geometry, maths and statistics
    - useful formulas and when to use what
